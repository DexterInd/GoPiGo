**Usage:**
- Make robot_web_server.py executable

 >      chmod +x robot_web_server.py

- Run robot_web_server.py
- Open a web browser on any computer or mobile device and enter the following in the address bar:

 >      dex.local:98
The page runs on dex.local or the IP address of the Pi on port 98

- The video stream would load up and you can use the joystick on the screen to control the GoPiGo
