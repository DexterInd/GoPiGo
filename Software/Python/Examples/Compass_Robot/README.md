## Compass Bot
### This is for using the GoPiGo with the compass as a turtle robot
This bot uses the grove compass module 

**Use the following commands for controlling the compass bot**
- _f dist_ 	:	move forward by "dist" (distance = dist/4 encoder counts. 1 rotation=18 encoder counts) e.g.: f 100
- _l deg_	:	rotate left by "deg" (l 45)
- _r deg_	:	rotate right by "deg" (r 45)
