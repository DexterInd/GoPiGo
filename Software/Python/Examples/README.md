## Python Examples
### This folder contains the basic Python examples and projects for the GoPiGo

- **Basic Robot Control** : Simply control the GoPiGo using the basic keyboard commands.  The simplest of the programs for using the GoPiGo.  Demonstrates how to command the GoPiGo motors.
- **GPS Bot** : Reads the GPS data from the Grove GPS module. Can be used to program the GoPiGo to follow way points.  Demonstrates how to access Grove sensors on the GoPiGo.
- **Streaming Video Example** : Stream video over the network using mpeg-streamer.  This example demonstrates video streaming from the GoPiGo and a Raspberry Pi camera.
- **Office Cannon** : Control the GoPiGo and the office cannon using a mouse connected to the Raspberry Pi.
- **Ultrasonic_Servo** : Advanced example that uses the Ultrasonic sensor and the Servo to map the surroundings like a LIDAR.
- **Compass Bot** : Uses the Grove Compass module to emulate the Turtle program on the software as well as with the GoPiGo.  Demonstrates how to use a Grove Compass with the GoPiGo.
- **Browser Streaming Bot** : Control the GoPiGo and stream video to a Browser on your computer, phone, or tablet.
- **Mouse Control** : Control the GoPiGo with mouse buttons and mouse scroll.
- **Basic Servo** : Control the servo motor on the GoPiGo with basic keyboard commands.  This example demonstrates servo control with the GoPiGo.
- **PS3 Control** : Control the GoPiGo with the PS3 controller.  This example demonstrates how to connect the Playstation 3 controller to the GoPiGo.
- **Ultrasonic Basic Obstacle Avoider** : Make an obstacle avoiding robot with the GoPiGo.  This is a basic demonstration of how to use the Ultrasonic Sensor with the GoPiGo.
- **Find_Hole** : Uses the ultrasonic sensor to scan the room and navigate through it
- **Gamepad** : Control the GoPiGo with the Logitech F710 Gamepad
- **LED_Blink** : Blink the LED's on the GoPigo
- **Ultrasonic Servo** : Use the ultrasonic ranger and a servo to scan a room and make a map of it
