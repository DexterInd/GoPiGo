# Quick Install

For installing the python package(s) of the GoPiGo, use the following command:
```
curl -kL dexterindustries.com/update_gopigo | bash
```

Or if you're still accustomed to the old ways, you can clone the repo, head over to the `Setup` folder and run the install script like this:
```
bash update_gopigo3.sh
```

These 2 methods of installing the robot are identical - the difference is that the former takes the script from an online source and in the latter case, you run it from the repository itself.
