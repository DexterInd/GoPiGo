# Assembly and Programming Files

These files were originally hosted on the Dexter Industries website.  With the introduction of the GoPiGo3, we have migrated all assembly and startup instructions to Github in PDF format.  

You can find a series of helpful videos for assembling and getting started with the GoPiGo1 and GoPiGo2 on Youtube:
