/* This file provides hardware support for the SAMD21G18A processor or as we 
 * will refer to it simply as SAMD 21. This processor is used in the Arduino Zero, 
 * Arduino M0, Arduino M0 Pro, and the Adafruit Feather M0 series boards as well as
 * the upcoming Adafruit Circuit Playground Express.
 * Most of the code has been adapted from messages on the Arduino.cc support forum 
 * and from the code at:
 *	https://github.com/manitou48/ZERO/tree/master/IRtest
 * Receiving is supported through all three receiver classes. As you would expect 
 * the IRrecvLoop class can be used with any available input pin. The IRrecvPCI and 
 * IRfrequency classes can be used on any pin that supports "attachInterrupt()". 
 * Specifically that means everything except pin 4 on the Arduino Zero. And everything 
 * except pin 2 on the boards from Arduino.org such as the Arduino M0, M0 Pro, and 
 * Zero Pro. For details on supported pins see these links:
 *	https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/AttachInterrupt
 *	http://www.arduino.org/learning/reference/AttachInterrupt
 * Note that although we support Arduino.org hardware, you should only use the 
 * Arduino.cc IDE for compiling your sketches.
 * Both sending and receiving use GCLK0 even though GCLK0-GCLK3 are generally reserved
 * the Arduino infrastructure. However we are using the default 48 MHz clock source
 * and a divisor of "1" so we aren't changing any of the GCLK0 set up. It's therefore
 * safe to use.
 * The IRrecv receiver class using a 50 microsecond timer interrupt is also supported. 
 * It defaults to using hardware timer TC3 however TC4 and TC5 can also be used in case 
 * of conflicts with other libraries. The IRrecv and IRrecvLoop classes should be able to use
 * any available input pin. Note that all of our example sketches used pin 2 for 
 * receiver and pin 3 for frequency measurement. However pin 2 is not available for PCI 
 * interrupts on the Arduino.org platforms and neither 2 nor 3 are available on the 
 * Adafruit Feather M0 platforms. We are recommending using 5 and 6 for receiving and
 * frequency measurement respectively.
 * For sending, you can use any pin that supports PWM on your particular 
 * platform. On Arduino Zero that means pins 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or 13.
 * Additionally Arduino M0 Pro adds pins 2 and 7 to that list. In all cases the default
 * output pin is 9. The code automatically selects TCC0 or TCC1 based on pin number
 * as needed. It has been tested at frequencies of 36, 38, 39, 40 and 57 which
 * are the frequencies of our supported protocols.
 * As of this release the code has been tested on Arduino Zero, Arduino M0 Pro, and 
 * Adafruit Feather M0 BLE version.
