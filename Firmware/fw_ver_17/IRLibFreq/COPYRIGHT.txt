Copyright information for IRLib – an Arduino library for 
infrared encoding and decoding

IRLib2 is a collection of libraries which we will collectively referred 
to as the PACKAGE. The PACKAGE consists of all files in the IRLib2, 
IRLibFreq, IRLibRecv, IRLibRecvPCI, and IRLibProtocols folders.

This is an updated version of my original IRLib which is still available at
https://github.com/cyborg5/IRLib which will not be updated after this 
PACKAGE has its first stable non-beta release.

Both libraries are derived from the original source code in a library called
IRemote by Ken Shirriff which was covered by GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC
LICENSE version 2.1. This package is covered by the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC
LICENSE 3.0.  See LICENSE.txt for a copy of that license or visit 
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/

As I understand these licenses it is permissible to upgrade the license 
this way.  Additionally this license change was made with the approval of
Mr. Shirriff in an email conversation I had with him. In accord with his
wishes and out of respect for his work, his original copyright message is
shown below.

We also acknowledge and thank the developers of the AnalysIR program. AnalysIR is a Windows-based application which allows you to graphically analyze IR input signals through an Arduino, Raspberry Pi or other microcontrollers systems. The frequency analysis and other PCI based versions of the program are based upon and inspired by their work. We value their input into the development of that portion of the code. You can find more about their software at http://analysir.com 

We also knowledge and thank programmer Gabriel Staples contributed bug fixes and an earlier version of the auto resume feature. Although much of his code was rewritten it could not have been possible without his contributions.

Other major contributors will be acknowledged in this file in the future.
