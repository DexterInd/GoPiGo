/* IRrecvBase.cpp
 * Part of IRLib Library for Arduino receiving, decoding, and sending
 * infrared signals. See COPYRIGHT.txt and LICENSE.txt for more information.
 *
 * This module contains the base class classes for receiving IR signals. You will not create
 * instances of this class, rather it is used as a base class for the 3 different
 * receiver classes. These are the original IRrecv which uses a 50us timer interrupt.
 * The IRrecvPCI version that uses pin change interrupts and IRrecvLoop which uses no timers
 * or interrupts. Each of these has its own .h and .cpp file.
 *
 * The IRrecvLoop files are in this folder.  However the other two receivers in their own 
 * separate libraries. That is because their interrupt service routines can conflict
 * with other ISRs. The ISRs conflict would occur even if you did not create an instance
 * of their receiver classes. Similarly the frequency detection receiver which also uses
 * interrupts is also in a separate folder IRLibFreq.
