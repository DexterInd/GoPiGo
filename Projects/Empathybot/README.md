# Empathybot: The Raspberry Pi Robot That Reads Human Emotion

![ GoPiGo ](https://github.com/DexterInd/GoPiGo/raw/master/Projects/Empathybot/Empathybot.jpg)

In this project we built emotional intelligence to our robot.  We developed a Raspberry Pi Robot with the GoPiGo that will drive up to you, read your emotions, and then try to have a conversation with you, based on how youâ€™re feeling.  We will show you how you too can build your own DIY emotion-reading robot with a Raspberry Pi.
